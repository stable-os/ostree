            At its core, ostree operates on an existing mounted filesystem.  Tooling such
            as <code class="literal">ostree admin deploy</code> will create a new directory that can be
            used as a bootable target.  This tool is designed to run in an initramfs and
            set up "remapping" mounts as a view into that filesystem.
        </p><p>
            As of more recently, this tool also has optional support for composefs, which
            creates a distinct mount point layered on top of the underlying filesystem.
        </p><p>
            The most common pattern today is to use systemd in an initramfs.  The systemd
            unit shipped upstream is ordered in this way:

            <code class="literal">After=sysroot.mount</code> and <code class="literal">Before=initrd-root-fs.target</code>
        </p><p>
            When it runs, the mounted filesystem at the provided <code class="literal">TARGET</code> (usually <code class="literal">/sysroot</code>)
            will be changed such that what appears at <code class="literal">/sysroot</code> is actually the
            "deployment root" - i.e. a particular versioned subdirectory.  What was formerly the
            "physical root" i.e. the real root of the filesystem will appear as <code class="literal">/sysroot/sysroot</code>.
        </p><p>
            For <code class="literal">/var</code>, by default a bind mount is created from the deployment root to <code class="literal">/sysroot/var</code>.
        </p><p>
            A read-only bind mount is created over <code class="literal">/sysroot/usr</code>.  The immutable bit is set on the deployment
            root, so this provides basic protection for filesystem mutation.  If the <code class="literal">sysroot.readonly</code>
            option is enabled, instead a writable bind mount for <code class="literal">/sysroot/etc</code>, and everything else
            is mounted read-only.
        </p><p>
            Finally, when higher level tooling such as systemd performs a switch-root operation, what
            was <code class="literal">/sysroot</code> becomes <code class="literal">/</code> and after the transition into
            the real root, the system will be booted into the "deployment", which is a versioned immutable
            filesystem tree.  The ostree tooling running in the real root thereafter performs further changes
            by operating on <code class="literal">/sysroot</code> which is now the "physical root".

            The <code class="literal">/usr/lib/ostree/prepare-root.conf</code> (or <code class="literal">/etc/ostree/prepare-root.conf</code>) config file is parsed by <code class="literal">ostree-prepare-root</code>.  This file must
            be present in the initramfs.  The default dracut module will copy it from the real root if present.

If this is set to <code class="literal">true</code>, then the <code class="literal">/sysroot</code> mount point is mounted read-only.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="varname">composefs.enabled</code></span></dt><dd><p>This can be <code class="literal">yes</code>, <code class="literal">no</code>. <code class="literal">maybe</code> or

                <code class="literal">signed</code>, then composefs is always used, and the boot fails if it is not
                available. Additionally if set to <code class="literal">signed</code>, boot will fail if the image cannot be
                validated by a public key. If set to <code class="literal">maybe</code>, then composefs is used if supported.

                <code class="literal">/etc/ostree/initramfs-root-binding.key</code>. For a valid signed boot the target OSTree
                commit must be signed by at least one public key in this file, and the commitfs digest listed in the
                commit must match the target composefs image.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id1339"></a><h2>systemd</h2><p>
            As mentioned above, this tool comes with a systemd unit file <code class="literal">ostree-prepare-root.service</code>
            and it is primarily expected to be invoked this way.
        </p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id1340"></a><h2>Composefs</h2><p>
            The default for ostree is to create a plain hardlinked filesystem tree.
            composefs support is currently experimental; see the upstream <code class="literal">doc/composefs.md</code>
            for more information on using it.
